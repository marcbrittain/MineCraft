# MineCraft

Welcome to the MineCraft video series code page! Here I have posted all of the code to the videos that are on youtube. If you have not checked out the videos yet, you can find the first one here! [Episode 1](https://youtu.be/36dcvShKctM)

In this series of episodes, our AI Ralph is tested in different scenarios within MineCraft. We were able to interface through MineCraft by using the **project malmo** package developed by Microsoft. It has a very simple API and is easy to get running...once installed. Each episode will provide a new challenge for Ralph and will become increasiliy more difficult as the episodes go on. We plan to push the current AI algorithms to the test in this series to see how well they perform. We also plan to test some new algorithms of our own in this series as well :) If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for new videos, feel free to send me an email.
